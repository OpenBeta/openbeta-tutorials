A, dirty, heinous off-width. Begin on the vertical section, which follows a fist crack to the steep roof. Invert into the roof and grovel your way to the top through dirt, mud, guano, and various plants.

Follow perfect crimps and edges up the vertical face until arriving at the bulge. Then, at the bulge, pull through the shouldery gaston crux to arrive at the chains.

Traverse up the sloper rail until arriving at a set of jugs halfway up the wall. Make a huge deadpoint off these jugs to a half pad crimp, match, and finish on jugs.

Scramble through a band of choss before arriving at the climb proper. Plug some gear and fire the first finger-jam crux to a jug rest. Finish up the strenuous, flared hand crack.

Sit start on two tiny crimps, lock off to the good pocket. From here jump to the jug on the lip and do an easy mantle to finish.

This route may cause you to void your bowels, attempt only if you are wearing brown pants.

The crux is where the route turns vertical and hinges on two long mono pulls.

Just a really massive dyno.

Extremely thin face climb up the black streak. Start with a few sketchy moves to the first bolt, then follow sustained edges and crimps to the top.

Compression up the refrigerator block to a big move at the lip.
